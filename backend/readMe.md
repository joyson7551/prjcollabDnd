## Currently working on

$$ frontend ideas
    - plan directory structure

    - auth
        reg
        login with token and bcrypt
    - private routes or protected routes for auth 
      check
  - owner/admin
      - admin/member/ navbar  
      - admin/member/ dashboard  
      - project component, with project details like 
        name, number of members, progress. for both owner/admin and members
      - dashboard with todo, in progress and completed coulmn
      - add task by admin/owner
      - edit task by admin/owner
      - delete task by admin/owner
      - comment task by admin/owner
      - assign  task to members by admin/owner
      - role change toggle inside the members list with 3 dots option
    - 
    
  - member
    - toggle task status
    - post comment.
    - edit comment.
    - delete comment.
  


- CRUD ops
- dedicated controllers for - 
      - completed
        - to change role- admin
        - add members (for owner and admin only).
        - delete member on the same project group member lists 
        - add tasks
        - edit tasks
        - list down the memebrs, get all members with role just 
          like whatsapp or telegram
        
      - pending
        - edit comment
        - delete comment
        - delete task
        - assigning task 
          - dedicated api for only existing members in the project.
        - 
        
- Member functionalities
      - delete comment with 3dots on the ri8 side
      - edit project details like.
            - dedicated 'updated on:' tag or text with updated date 
              and time.(so the user can identify 
              the updates easily).
            - this includes adding comments also
    - completed
      - Member can change the status like in progress, completed..
      - add comment in tasks(only assigned members and admin/owner 
        can comment)
      - edit comment with 3dots on the ri8 side
      - 
      

## methods can be used in this for filtering and other array ops
  ## reduce 
    can utilize 'reduce' fn to group the users according to admin and member.
  ## Deep filtering object
    using .some , will pick up the matched value from the array.  
    
    Simple filtering â†’ filter()

    Single item â†’ find()

    Nested data â†’ flatMap() or reduce()

    Existence check â†’ some()/every()    
  

## Next focus

- member apis
- CRUD for members.

## completed

- login reg with jwt and bcrypt
- creating(post) project with owner id
- fetching (get) all projects with for admin

## Schema ideas

Save project id to user data in an array where all the project id will be stored

or

object id is better? check on this.
    - helpful id filter, map functions. so keep it 

member addition- check user data and block foreign 

## need to add comment section with latest comments at the bottom with time added..
